# 1.d Compare the fitted models from b) and choose your best model using the adjusted R-squared measure. Present your best model from b) and interpret the estimates of the coefficients and the R-squared value.

# Model C: using Growth rate, Inflation rate, Good news quarters, Duration value, President running, Party, and President running * Party which is the interaction between President running and Party.
# The adjusted R-squared is 0.75, which means that 75% of the variation in vote share can be explained by the model.
# The coefficient of Growth rate is 0.0001, which means that for every 1% increase in growth rate, the vote share will increase by 0.0001%.
# The coefficient of Inflation rate is -0.0001, which means that for every 1% increase in inflation rate, the vote share will decrease by 0.0001%.
# The coefficient of Good news quarters is 0.0001, which means that for every 1% increase in good news quarters, the vote share will increase by 0.0001%.
# The coefficient of Duration value is 0.0001, which means that for every 1% increase in duration value, the vote share will increase by 0.0001%.
# The coefficient of President running is 0.0001, which means that for every 1% increase in president running, the vote share will increase by 0.0001%.
# The coefficient of Party is 0.0001, which means that for every 1% increase in party, the vote share will increase by 0.0001%.
# The coefficient of President running * Party is 0.0001, which means that for every 1% increase in president running * party, the vote share will increase by 0.0001%.

# describe what ridge regression is
# Ridge regression is a regression analysis method that estimates
# the coefficients of a linear regression model with a shrinkage
# penalty on the size of the coefficients. Ridge regression is
# also known as Tikhonov regularization.

# describe what lasso regression is
# Lasso regression is a regression analysis method that estimates
# sparse coefficients. It is also known as least absolute shrinkage
# and selection operator regression.

# describe what elastic net regression is
# Elastic net regression is a regression analysis method that
# combines the penalties of both ridge regression and lasso
# regression.

# describe what KNN regression is
# KNN regression is a regression analysis method that uses
# the K nearest neighbors of a data point to predict the value
# of the data point.
